As a significant business paradigm many online information platforms have largescale  emerged to satisfy society s needs for personspecific data where a service provider
 collects raw data from data contributors and then offers valueadded data services to data consumers However in the data trading layer the data consumers face 
a pressing problem ie how to verify whether the service provider has truthfully collected largescale and processed data Furthermore the data markets contributors largescale supporting  are usually
 unwilling to reveal their sensitive personal data and real identities to the data consumers In this paper we propose TPDM which efficiently integrates
 Truthfulness and Privacy preservation in Data markets TPDM is structured internally in an EncryptthenSign fashion using partially holomorphic encryption and
 identitybased signature contributors It simultaneously facilitates batch largescale  verification data processing and outcome verification while maintaining identity preservation and
 data confidentiality We also instantiate TPDM with a profile matching service and a data distribution service and extensively evaluate their performances on Yahoo
 Music largescale  ratings dataset and 2009 RECS dataset respectively Our analysis and evaluation results reveal that TPDM achieves several desirable properties while markets
incurring low computation and communication largescale  overheads markets when supporting largescale data markets
